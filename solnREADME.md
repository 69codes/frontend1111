one page pratctice in 2020 dont mind me
I have previous experience, but it's been long since i last coded HTML and CSS, i wanted to revise on what i know before.
The problem had three diiferent sections joined together, so i thought about flex layout as the best approach- it helps with responsiveness.
The HTML was stright forward, i used <span></span> for inline textes and <p></p> for texts taking different lines.
I used ,<ul></ul> if the texts had a particular place to stop.
The CSS was striaght forward, but since the exact dimensions were not given i used my initiative, both for color and sizes
